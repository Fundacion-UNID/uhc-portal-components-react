# Changelog

## 0.1.3

- Add the brand-neutral `ClinicalSectionSummary` renderer for resolved IPS
  cards. Clinical terminology tokens remain translation keys and are never
  derived into editable or visible names by the component.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-29

- Added a framework-neutral branding module for official light/dark surface
  artwork with explicit intrinsic dimensions.
- Replaced synthetic text monograms and forced gradient shapes in the shared
  header and hero with undistorted brand-provided assets.
- Added regression coverage for official asset paths, surface variants and
  intrinsic proportions.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-29

- Added publishable shell, entry hero and real-page access chooser modules.
- Added account/profile slots so personal and professional portals share the
  same UI behavior while host runtimes retain authentication and authorization.
- Defined the brand-only reuse contract for UHC and VetChain portal families.
- Ported the corrected UHC Personal light/dark tokens: dark mode changes
  surfaces and text contrast while primary/selected controls retain the exact
  light-mode turquoise-to-blue gradient.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-29

- Add a brand-neutral account/preferences header with theme, S/M/L density,
  language, guest and sign-out actions.
- Add a fail-closed protected-profile/PIN gate driven by host-owned
  `ProfileRuntime` state.
- Add theme tokens configurable for UHC and VetChain portal families.
